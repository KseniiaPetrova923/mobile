# Mobile application testing
I tested a mobile application "shopping-list", designed for creating and managing a list of tasks.

## Requirements analysis and test documentation preparation:

## Test summary report:
To analyze the quality of the shopping-list mobile application, I compiled a test summary report, including:
-the total number of launched test cases and their results.
-the number of defects found, classified by priority.
-analysis of test coverage of key functionality.
-conclusions about the current state of the product.

## Using of Charles Proxy:
To test the shopping-list mobile application, I used a sniffer to intercept, modify and analyze HTTP requests. As part of testing, I completed the following tasks.

*Changing the request to remove an item from the cart:
Using a breakpoint, I intercepted a request to delete one product and changed it so that another product was deleted instead.

*Simulation of content substitution:
I set up interception of a request to https://demoshopping.ru and changed the response so that a random picture was loaded instead of the site.

*Intercepting an HTTPS request from a mobile device:
I analyzed the applicationâ€™s network traffic and recorded one of the intercepted requests.
